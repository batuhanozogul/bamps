# bamps
BAMPS is a python powered apache mysql php manager and vhost configer for windows as an alternative to xampp

bamps is currently in development ‚è∞
Any pr and issue is welcome.

## What is bamp
Bamp is a web server manager i made for windows
## Was this nessesary?
As i seen on market there is low count of apache php managers for windows, exist managers are for development purposes etc.
Bamps aims stability and easy to use
## Why not linux?
I may port this app to run on linux later. but i dont have such plan on my sight for near future.
I know windows hosting is not amazing but it doesn't mean it shouldn't have to exist.
